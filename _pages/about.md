I'm an interdisciplinary researcher interested in questions about how cultural behavior is learned, how it changes over time, and especially how social factors can impact that change. To answer these questions, I use cultural evolution experiments on great tits, a passerine species which maintains cultural traditions. Verbal hypotheses about cultural change can be tricky, so I also create mathematical models to help validate them. Currently, I'm working towards my PhD in the Cognitive and Cultural Ecology Lab at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. In my off time, I like to be creative, and enjoy programming, drawing and making music as hobbies.
