I'm an interdisciplinary researcher interested in questions about how cultural behavior is learned, how it changes over time, and how social factors can impact that change. I have developed automated data collection methods to uncover the mechanisms that link individual-level decision-making, social structures and processes, and the environment to culture. I study two urban adaptor species as models of animal culture: the great tit and sulphur-crested cockatoo, and use insights from empirical studies to inform theoretical models that are generalizable across species. In my spare time, I like to dj and make electronic music. Check out my [yt channel](https://youtube.com/@puzzlbox) and [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/puzzlebox) for more!
