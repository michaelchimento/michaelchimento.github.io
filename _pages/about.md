I'm an interdisciplinary researcher interested in questions about how cultural behavior is learned, how it changes over time, and especially how social factors can impact that change. To answer these questions, I use cultural evolution experiments on great tits, a passerine species which maintains cultural traditions. Verbal hypotheses about cultural change can be difficult to reason through, so I also create computational models to help validate them. Currently, I'm a postdoc at the Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour and the University of Zurich. I am also affiliated with the MPI-AB. In my off time, I like to be creative, and hobby around with programming, drawing and making music.
