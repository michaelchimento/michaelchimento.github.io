I am an interdisciplinary researcher interested in questions about how cultural behavior is learned, how it changes over time, and how social factors can impact that change. I develop automated data collection methods to uncover the mechanisms that link individual-level decision-making, social structures and processes, and the environment to culture. I study two urban adaptor species as models of animal culture: the great tit and sulphur-crested cockatoo, and use insights from empirical studies to inform theoretical models that are generalizable across species. In 2024, I was awarded the Richerson Award for Outstanding Doctoral Research by the Cultural Evolution Society. I am currently a postdoc at the Centre for Collective Behaviour at the University of Konstanz. 

I am developing an R package for the Bayesian modeling of social transmission in networked populations: [STbayes](https://michaelchimento.github.io/STbayes/). If you'd like to use this on your own data and don't mind being a bit of a guinea pig, please reach out.

In my spare time, I like to dj and make electronic music. Feel free to check out my [yt channel](https://youtube.com/@theque_cachee) and [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/theque_cachee)!
