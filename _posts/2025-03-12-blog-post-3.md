This post simulates a dataset where task performance increases depend on a continuous variable. I simulate the dataset, fit a GLMM, and plot the continuous x continous interaction from the model with CI. Read on [here](https://github.com/michaelchimento/logistic_regrets/blob/main/plotting_continuous_interactions_lmer.md).
